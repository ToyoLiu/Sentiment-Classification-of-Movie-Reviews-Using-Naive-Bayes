### Sentiment Classification of Movie Reviews Using Naive Bayes

**Brief Description:**
  
Developed a sentiment classification model for IMDB movie reviews using the Naive Bayes algorithm, focusing on distinguishing between positive and negative reviews and analyzing the impact of hyperparameters on model accuracy.

**Time Period:**  
Oct 2023 - Nov 2023

**Tools:**  
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, PyCharm

**Key Achievements:**
- Implemented data preprocessing steps, including tokenization and padding of text sequences, to prepare the IMDB movie review dataset for training and testing.
- Constructed a Naive Bayes classifier using a Bag of Words model, achieving a high classification accuracy on the IMDB dataset by fine-tuning hyperparameters.
- Conducted experiments to analyze the effects of different training set ratios and maximum feature sizes on the model’s accuracy, providing insights into optimizing model performance.
- Visualized the relationship between training set proportions, feature sizes, and model accuracy to identify the optimal configuration for sentiment classification tasks.
